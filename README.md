Task 1: Data Preparation and Integration
Objective:
Integrate two different IoT telemetry JSON data formats from Daikibo’s factories into a single, unified format for analysis.

Details:

The client provided two separate JSON files, each with a unique structure, representing machine status at different times and locations.

The task requires writing Python code to:

Parse and inspect both data formats.

Map and restructure each into a standardized format.

Merge the results into a single consolidated JSON file.

This process simulates a common real-world scenario of data preparation, crucial for analytics projects.

Skills demonstrated: JSON manipulation, Python scripting, handling structured data, and basic unit testing for code validation.
Task 2: Data Analysis and Visualization
Objective:
Analyze telemetry data from four global Daikibo factories to identify failure trends, and visualize the results in a Tableau dashboard.

Details:

Provided with a month’s worth of machine status logs (JSON format) from four factories, covering nine different machine types.

Tasks include:

Building Tableau visualizations to determine:

Which factory had the most machine breakdowns during May 2021.

Which types of machines failed most often at the worst-performing site.

Creating dashboards such as:

“Down Time per Factory”: A bar chart to summarize total machine failures by location.

“Down Time per Device Type”: A device-based breakdown, filtered dynamically by the selected factory.

Using Tableau to design, filter, and present actionable insights to stakeholders.

Skills demonstrated: Data aggregation, visualization design, dashboard interactivity, drawing business conclusions from ana
